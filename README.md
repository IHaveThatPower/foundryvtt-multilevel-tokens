# Multilevel Tokens module for Foundry VTT

This is a (hopefully temporary) fork of the original Multilevel Tokens module for Foundry VTT created by user grandseiken. The original can be found [here](https://github.com/grandseiken/foundryvtt-mulitlevel-tokens).

The goal of this fork is to provide short-term compatibility fixes for Foundry v10. For detailed instructions on how to use this module, please see the proper documentation above.
